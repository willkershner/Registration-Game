# Download wxWidgets
Follow the instructions on the official wxWidgets website to download and install wxWidgets for your operating system: [wxWidgets Download](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/)

### To Compile the code:
`
g++ main.cpp `wx-config --libs --cxxflags` -o mainApp
`

I adjusted all images to 20 inches wide and locked aspect ratio.



Things to still do:
- Add a a countdown timer before the game starts
- Keep track of time
- Implement a leaderboard system
- Add buttons at the correct position
- Delete button and load next background image when button is clicked and load new buttons
